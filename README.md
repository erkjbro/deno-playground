> My Deno Land

[Deno](https://deno.land "Deno Land") is a **secure** runtime for
**JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.

This is just a playground I'm using to try out some basic testing
with Deno.

## oak

This REST API uses [oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/ "oak | A middleware framework for Denoâ€™s net server ðŸ¦•"), which is a middleware framework for Deno's http server.

> It's apparently inspired by Koa, but I'm not familiar with Koa so idk.

An interesting intro I found to try building a REST API:
